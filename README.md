# LTC in OBS

This is a plugin script writen in python to use in the Open Brodcast Software (OBS). The main objective was to add the capture of an LTC signal through an audio input. However, other features were added which are summarized in the features section.
## Features
- Capture LTC through an audio input. Any analog input will do the work.
> If it is a stereo input, the left channel must be used.
- Internal video switcher.
> Dynamically created OBS Hotkeys can be maped to keyboard keys to act as a source swicher.

> Arduino serial I/O for switcher control. Arduino code and schematics included. Designed to use push buttons but can be adapted to GPIO interfaces.

- Start and stop recording controled by the script.
- LTC can be displayed in a OBS Text source.
- Creates a EDL file with the cuts from the switcher.
